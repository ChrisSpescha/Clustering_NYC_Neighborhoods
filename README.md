## Hello and Welcome!!!

The idea of this project is to segment the neighborhoods of New York City into separate clusters and examine the information about them. A desirable intention is to create the neighborhood cluster’s based on the various information we are able to find, for example:


### Files

- **data_preparation.ipynb** - contains information about data preparation/cleaning/EDA
- **modeling.ipynb** - contains information about the modeling part of the project

### Data

All info can be found on NYC Open Data



### How to Start

As the first step, we need to parse the original JSON file with the neighborhoods into the Pandas. Afterward, we can start to gather different data from various sources. Spend some time on research of different APIs that could be used. Information from all data sources need to be joined with the neighborhoods before we can proceed with feature engineering and clustering itself. Do not forget about visualizations of clusters and neighborhoods as well becaue there is a lot of things that can be done in this area.
